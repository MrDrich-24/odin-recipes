    <h4>This apple cranberry pie is a modified apple pie recipe my mother has had for years. I prefer a combination of Braeburn, Fuji, and McIntosh apples.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package pastry for a double-crust 9-inch pie</li>
        <li>4 cups peeled and sliced apples</li>
        <li>2 cups cranberries</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, cut into small pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust. </li>
        <li>Arrange sliced apples in prepared crust; spread cranberries over apples. Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over cranberries. Distribute butter pieces over pie filling.</li>
        <li>Cover filling with remaining pie crust; crimp both crusts together, and cut several slits into top crust to vent steam.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pie is browned and fruit filling is bubbling, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
